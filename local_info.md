#### Accommodation 

During the summer season, Varna becomes a busy tourist destination and finding accommodation may get difficult. We therefore advise booking your stay as early as possible. In general, we recommend booking accommodation in the city centre, or close to the sea in walking distance from the conference venue. 
  
We have negotiated discounted prices for QPL participants at the hotels listed below. Prices are given in Bulgarian lev, or BGN, where 1 EUR = 1.9558 BGN.

#### Poster Instructions

Ideally, posters should be printed on A0 size (84,1 cm x 118,9 cm) paper or similar material in portrait (vertical) orientation, leaving a 6 cm margin on the top and a 6 cm margin on the bottom within the A0 size. These margins are required because of the attachment mechanisms on the poster boards at our disposal, which use some of the space around the top and bottom edges and limit the vertical size of the visible area to 110 cm. The side (left and right) margins are not essential, but the total horizontal size should not exceed that of the A0 format (84,1 cm) so that the poster can enter the attachment mechanisms.

Posters exceeding A0 size risk being unsuitable for the boards, so they should be strongly avoided. Smaller posters are OK, but they may have to be attached by tape.
