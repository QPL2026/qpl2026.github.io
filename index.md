The **23rd International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2026)**
will take place from August 17th to August 21st 2026 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  Quantum
Physics and Logic is an annual conference that brings together academic and
industry researchers working on mathematical foundations of quantum
computation, quantum physics, and related areas. The main focus is on the use
of algebraic and categorical structures, formal languages, type systems,
logics, semantic methods, as well as other mathematical and computer scientific
techniques applicable to the study of physical systems, physical processes, and
their composition. Work applying quantum-inspired techniques and structures to
other fields, such as linguistics, artificial intelligence, and causality, is
also welcome.


### Important Dates

Conference: August 17th to August 21st 2026

Submission and registration dates to follow.

<!-- * Abstract submission deadline: 9 February 2025

### Submissions

The following are the submission guidelines from the 2025 edition, they are still subject to change.
Prospective speakers are invited to submit one (or more) of the following:

* **Proceedings submission.** This consists of a 5-12 page paper. It must
  provide sufficient evidence of results of genuine interest, in sufficient
  detail for the program committee to assess the merits and correctness of the work.
  Proceedings submissions must use the [EPTCS style files](https://style.eptcs.org/).
* **Talk proposal.** This consists of a 3 page summary, together with
  a link to a separate published paper or preprint. If the published paper or
  preprint is not publicly available (e.g. not open access), then it should be
  included in full after the summary.
* **Poster submission.** This consists of a 3 page summary of results, partial results or
  work in progress.

Page limits exclude bibliography and appendices (which may be read at the
discretion of reviewers). 
<!-- All submissions will be handled by EasyChair.
[Submit here](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=qpl2025).
 -->
There will be an award for Best Student Paper that will be determined by the
Program Committee. Papers eligible for the award are those where all the
authors are students at the time of submission.

### Registration

To open later.
<!-- Registration is now closed. Please see [here](/registration/) for further information regarding registrations. -->

<!-- ### Presentations

Authors of accepted proceedings and non-proceedings submissions will be invited
to give a talk. Authors of accepted poster submissions will be invited to present
their work at the poster session.

[Conference program](/program/)

All talks will be 20 minutes long plus 5 minutes for questions. -->
<!-- 
#### Posters

Please see [here](/local_info/#poster-instructions) for guidance on preparing posters. -->

### Conference Proceedings

Conference proceedings will be published in [Electronic Proceedings in
Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS)](https://about.eptcs.org/) after the
conference. When preparing the final version for publication, authors of
accepted proceedings submissions are allowed to use up to three extra pages
(i.e. up to 15 pages excluding bibliography) to address reviewer concerns and
suggestions under the proviso that they do not introduce new results.

<!-- #### Special Issue
In addition to the proceedings, we will have a Special Issue at JLAMP. [Check the details and the call-for-papers at the journal site](https://www.sciencedirect.com/special-issue/321902/special-issue-on-quantum-physics-and-logic-qpl-2024-and-qpl-2025).
